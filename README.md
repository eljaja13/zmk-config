Installing Firmware
Installing firmware on the nice!nano is easy.

Plug in your nice!nano to your computer.
Enter the bootloader by double-tapping the reset button.
(You can skip this if you haven't flashed the nice!nano before)
Drag and drop the .uf2 file onto the NICENANO drive or copy it with your terminal.
After flashing is complete, the drive will disappear and the nice!nano will reboot.
Your computer may report an error when transferring the file, you can likely ignore this.1
If you haven't yet, you can turn the power switch on by pushing it up on the side of the keyboard.
